## ❓ FAQ (OPTIONAL) <a name="faq"></a>

- **How is the ranking of the cryptocurrency exchanges determined?**

  - The ranking of the exchanges is determined based on their trading volume, as reported by the CoinGecko API, which aggregates data from various sources. The app ranks the exchanges by their trading volume over a 24-hour period.

- **Can I search for specific exchanges on the app?**

  - Yes, you can! The app includes a search bar that allows you to search for exchanges by name. Simply type in the name of the exchange you're looking for, and the app will display a list of all exchanges that match your search query.
